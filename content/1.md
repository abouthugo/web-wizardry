> - Like a flower in wilt
> - This garden now stands
> - Once a bloom so bright
> - With beauty in its hands
> -
> -
> - But keepers with deceit turned the soil
> - With a guise of righteousness
> - And in the grief of loss
> - They the garden did lure

> - Fragmentation did they cause
> - And the tenders split
> - Some saw the truth
> - Others, the keepers wit

> - The garden's petals fell
> - And its stem did bend
> - A garden unkempt
> - And its beauty at an end

> - A caution we must take
> - In keepers to believe
> - For like a damsel in distress
> - This garden's beauty now wanes
