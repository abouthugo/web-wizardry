Like a flower in wilt
This garden now stands
Once a bloom so bright
With beauty in its hands

But keepers with deceit turned the soil
With a guise of righteousness
And in the grief of loss
They the garden did lure

Fragmentation did they cause
And the tenders split
Some saw the truth
Others, the keepers wit

The garden's petals fell
And its stem did bend
A garden unkempt
And its beauty at an end

A caution we must take
In keepers to believe
For like a damsel in distress
This garden's beauty now wanes
